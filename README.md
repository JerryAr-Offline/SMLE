# SMLE

That's right,another LeeEnfield.

(WE STILL NEED MORRRRRE)

The box magazine is changeable，but you only got one mag for each gun.

It also got a muzzle mount to fix bayonet and adjustable rear sight.

The gun firing 7.62x54R Russian cartridge with huge vertical recoil,which is unforgivable.

(BUT I can't bear with fake .303 model anymore)

(Huge thanks to Arpy who helps made the wooden texture for me.)
